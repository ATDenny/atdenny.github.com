                        My duties included overseeing all daily operations of both programs, such as: instructor/sim qualifications, & scheduling, client records, progress & satisifaction. 
                        I was responsible for the successful installation and integration of the VITAL 1100 visual display on the DA2000 LVL D sim, and the Honeywell Primus 2000 Elite II avionics suite with SVS for the DA900EX LVL D sim.
                        I was also an instructor and TCE for the Pilatus PC-12/47 and PC-12/47E programs, conducting checks and tests for a variety of NAAs. 
                        I conducted FAR135.293/.297 checks as a CCA for 45+ individual FAR135 Operators.</p>
                    <p>This position made me continue to grow as a manager, responsible for 6-10 direct-report instructors and programs worth millions of dollars on an annual basis. 
                        It also allowed me to hone my technical skills and knowledge bases as a pilot and advanced pilot instructor.</p>

                         I flew ~1000 hrs in 2 years, gaining invaluable operating experience in all types of flight conditions in Citation II, V, and Ultras. 
                         Regular operations into high-density traffic airports, remote airfields with minimal services, and mountainous terrain airports all gave me a strong operational foundation - which I still rely on to this day.</p>

                            After working primarily with collegiate students training at a slower pace at UND, US Aviation Academy gave me an introduction into accelerated Part 141 Ab-Initio style training.
                            I worked primarily with Air China cadets, and it was at US Aviation Academy where I had my first student solo sign-off as a CFI. 
                            Ultimately I would leave after 4 months due to an opportunity to progress my career with Transpac Aviation Academy.</p>

                            I am thankful to have been given the opportunity to join such a prestigious institution as the University of North Dakota. UND's reputation is well-earned.
                            The faculty and facilities are second to none, and I credit my year in Grand Forks with instilling me with core values that have guided my career ever since - an unerring commitment to safety and customer service.
                            My time at UND was mainly spent as a CFII, focusing on Instrument and Comm SEL collegiate courses.</p>
                        <p>UND is where I made the transition from a private pilot mindset to a professional pilot mindset. Even now years later, I still routinely draw upon lessons learned there on how to prepare for any flight.</p>
