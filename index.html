                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Looking to get to know me? You've come to the right place. My name is Arthur T. Denny. I was born just outside of Philadelphia, PA, but moved home to Ft. Worth, Texas before I was 6 mo. old.
                    I grew up in a family with deep roots to aviation, and spent my childhood cruising around North Texas in my dad's Piper Cherokee 140.
                    Some of my earliest memories are from that cockpit, and those formative experiences molded my love for aviation.</p>
                <p>I attended The University of Texas at Austin (Hook 'Em, Horns!), graduating with a Bachelors degree in History in 2011. 
                    I've always loved the great state of Texas and I'm proud to be a Texas Ex. 
                    While I was at UT, I was a member of the Spirit Squad, acting as a cheerleader and the on field suited mascot, Hook 'Em.</p>
                <p>I met my wonderful wife after graduation, and we bonded over a shared interest in aviation, among other things. 
                    We were married in 2016, and now have two little boys who are without fail two of the best parts of my day. Like me, they both look towards the sky at the sound of airplanes overhead.</p>
                <p>During my free time, I enjoy spending time outdoors, photography, and hanging out with the family. We've currently got a Beauceron named Hank, who combined with the the kids, keeps us active and on our toes.</p>
                <p>For a more comprehensive professional background and history, please feel free to visit either my <a href="./Pilot/HTML/pilot.html">Pilot</a> and/or <a href="">Programmer</a> pages.</p>
